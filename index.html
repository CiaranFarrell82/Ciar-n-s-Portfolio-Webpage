                My name is Ciarán Farrell, I am currently studying Enterprise Computing in DCU and I am 18 years old. I have a few different hobbies including: Gaming, MMA and Coding. I really enjoy listening to rap and hip hop music. My favorite artist at the moment is definitely The Kid Laroi.<br> Currently I am improving my coding skills by doing different courses on the Udemy website. My favorite coding language at the moment would have to be Swift as I am aiming to become an iOS developer when I finish college and recieve my degree.

                I am currently working in Harvey Norman in Swords Airside retail park, my job title is under part time sales assistant. The work I do consists of EPOS responsibilities, managing stock and answering customer queries. I really enjoy working in Harvey Norman, the atmosphere is great and all of the staff are really nice and welcoming. I am based in the audio/visual section of the shop floor where I sell products ranging from top quality televisions to cheaper bluetooth speakers. I have very good technical product knowledge and always make sure I understand a product before selling it.<br>
